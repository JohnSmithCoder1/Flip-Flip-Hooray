Designed for toddlers and preschoolers, Flip Flip Hooray is a memory matching game that helps little ones learn shapes, animals, and foods through fun and engaging play.

Perfect for ages 2 to 8+, this simple, kid-friendly app builds early memory skills, improves focus, and encourages visual recognition — all while having fun!

Why Kids (and Parents) Love It:
* 4 game themes: shapes, animals, foods, and all
* Adjustable difficulty for ages 2 to 8+

Made with Little Learners in Mind:
We designed Flip Flip Hooray for toddlers and preschoolers just starting their learning journey. With simple interactions and playful feedback, it’s easy for little fingers to play on their own—or together with a grown-up.
