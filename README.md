# Flip-Flip-Hooray

Designed for toddlers and preschoolers, Flip Flip Hooray is a memory matching game that helps little ones learn shapes, animals, and foods through fun and engaging play.

Perfect for ages 1 to 5, this simple, kid-friendly app builds early memory skills, improves focus, and encourages visual recognition —all while having fun!

Why Kids (and Parents) Love It:
* 3 game themes: animals, foods, and shapes
* Adjustable difficulty for ages 1–5 and beyond
* Kid-safe design with no ads or confusing menus
* Colorful art and sounds to keep kids engaged
* Supports early learning and cognitive development

Made with Little Learners in Mind:
We designed Flip Flip Hooray for toddlers and preschoolers just starting their learning journey. With simple interactions and playful feedback, it’s easy for little fingers to play on their own—or together with a grown-up.

No ads. No pop-ups. No in-app purchases. No sign-up. Just fun learning.
